todo / virtual reminiscences

World
* the shepard's flock: assimilation enemy
* 'mining-drone' like enemy

Mechanic
* localized space - why?
    * solar radiation
    * subspace interference
    * don't explain it, just stop updating their position server-wide and have them float off into space
    * gravity well prevents subspace distortions
